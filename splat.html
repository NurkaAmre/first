    <p>Splat doesn't want to go to school. He has tried every excuse: a bad fur day, no clean socks; but Mom insists. Splat is going to school. He packs Seymour (a mouse) in his lunchbox so that he has a friend. When his teacher explains that cats chase mice, Splat gets nervous. When the other cats see Seymour, they start chasing him. Oh no! What will Splat do? Will he be the hero cat or the laughing stock?</p>
